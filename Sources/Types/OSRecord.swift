/// `OSRecord` is an object representing a row in your database. It can be modified to keep certain properties or hide data. It's a pretty light object that helps OrionSearch unifying its ecosystem architecture without using native objects for better integration across all the different platforms.
///
/// The `OSRecord` object will mostly be used as a read-only property given by the `perform` method in `OrionSearch`. But it can also be created manually for in-memory databases:
/// ```swift
/// let record = OSRecord(data: [ ... ]) // creates the record
/// ```
///
/// ## Accessing the data
///
/// `OSRecord` has a simple `data` property to access the data originally given.
/// ```swift
/// record.data["myproperty"]
/// ```
public class OSRecord {
    
    /// record's data
    public var data: [String: Any]
    /// Record's score. Used for sorting.
    public var score: Double = 0

    ///
